Main tips to avoid falling into a phising attempt:
- Always check for the URL of the page and evident graphical errors in the page
- Go to the page directly by the browser instead of going by suspicious links

Tricks used by hackers to trick the users:
- Make the page look as close as the original page as they can
- They use a technique called Typosquatting in order to fool us into thinking that the URL is the correct one:
	- URL Hijacking: gooogle.com
	- Prepending: ggoogle.com
- Pretexting: Make the victim think that the attacker is someone else by tricking it with fake information. The most common way of doing this is by impersonating someone, just like what happens with call scams.
