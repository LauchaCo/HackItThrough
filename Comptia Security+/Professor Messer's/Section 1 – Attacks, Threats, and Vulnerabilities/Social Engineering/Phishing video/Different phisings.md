__Vishing (Voice phising)__ is quite similar to the normal phising but it's made over the phone or voicemail. Some common techniques are:
- Caller ID spoofing
- Fake security checks or bank updates

There is also another technique called __Smishing (SMS phising)__. This attack vector is the same as Vishing but it's done with the text messages asking for personal information or forwarding links

There are a lot of phising variants like: Fake check scam, phone verification code scam, Boss/CEO scam, advance-fee scam. A good resource for all types of phishings is https://reddit.com/r/Scams
