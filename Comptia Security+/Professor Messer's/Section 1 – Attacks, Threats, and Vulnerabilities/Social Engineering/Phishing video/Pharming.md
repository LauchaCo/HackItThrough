This technique basically makes the people who enter a legit website be redirected to a bogus site with a Poisoned DNS server or client vulnerabilities. This technique has a broader target because of its nature of targeting a group instead of an individual

This attack vector can be combined with phishing in order to bait the victim into clicking the real URL but with a poisoned DNS server that redirects it to a fake website:
- Pharming - Harvest large groups of people
- Phishing - Collect access credentials

The main advantadge of this attack is that is difficult for anti-malware software to stop it and, besides that, everything in the website and mail appears legitimate to the user
